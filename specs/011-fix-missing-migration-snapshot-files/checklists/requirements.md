# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Missing Migration Snapshot Files

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- `/speckit-specify` validation passed.
- The issue text names five missing snapshots, but repository inspection shows `0012_snapshot.json` is also absent while `0012_prompt_registry_projects.sql` exists. The spec treats the issue acceptance criterion, "Every `.sql` file under `drizzle/migrations/` has a matching `meta/NNNN_snapshot.json`", as the controlling requirement.
